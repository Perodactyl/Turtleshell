# Turtle Shell
	Turtle Shell is a simple, unnofficial shell I'm working on. It's missing several core features as of yet (such as running executables,) but it's still a pretty neat project.
## Installation
	After cloning the repo, run `npm install` to fetch the dependencies and then use `node .` to run. Make sure the typescript has compiled first or it won't run.

P.S: This is configured so that `tsc` is in watch mode.
